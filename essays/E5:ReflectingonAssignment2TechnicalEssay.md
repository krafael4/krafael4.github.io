## Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

 Assignment 2 is a continuation of assignment one but with the added benefits of a login page, registration page, and some security parameters. If you are interested in the details, look[HERE](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html).


 ## What did you learn from this assignment?
 
 I learned a lot from this assignment, but the main takeaway is the creation of login and registration forms. Specifically, I learned how to dynamically and locally add data through server.js and HTML. Additionally, I learned how to create specific guidelines for input text. For example, I learned how to set guidelines for an email. Specifically, how to limit characters and keep an email's format. Lastly, I learned how to grind code in a matter of hours. I regrettably learned that I should add more workload to my days. 


## Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself). How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

I did not work with a partner; instead, I worked with Professor Port and ChatGPT. If I were to work with a partner, I would split the load to match our strengths. I would also make sure that the workload is split evenly. If I needed help with code, I messaged Professor Port on Discord. I also "RTFM'ed" code or got help from ChatPGT. Lastly, I utilized the Professor's screencast for the last half of the requirements.  I needed help making input texts sticky and adding the quantities to the query string. Additionally, I needed help displaying the user's email in the invoice.html. 


## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

The development for this assignment was much harder than assignment 1. In assignment 1, we were given most of the code and only had to work on the styling of our store.html and invoice.html. Overall, assignment 1 was much easier because all the course workloads contributed to that assignment. Assignment 3, on the other hand, was very difficult because we had to start (sort of) from scratch. Additionally, we only had 1 lab that taught us this type of coding. Overall, I would say that the development was very difficult if you are a beginner and not as tech-savvy (but I can't complain because that is the point of the assignment). 


## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

I would say that most of the time was spent thinking about how to do something. then writing code, then testing and debugging. If I were to assign percentages, it would be 50% A, 25% B, 25% C. I think this decision to spend most time on A led to my downfall. I wish I could have spent 50% coding and 25% thinking. Overall, this assignment did not start off the greatest because I was a headless chicken. I should have grinded, grinded, and studied code (sorry if that sounds cliche). 


## Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

The one thing that worked well was getting the login.html and registration.html up and running. These were the easiest because they involved styling and linking pages together. Another thing that worked well was the error messages that pop up when a user types in information in either register or login. One thing that did not work out was the stickiness of the input text. The professor had to hand me that code because I was so lost. Another thing that did work well was my time management. I took the extra time for granted, and that will be greatly reflected in the score I received. 


## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

I would do everything differently. I would research and see code meanings. I would work on the Lab that went with this assignment outside of class. I would spend more time coding instead of thinking of what to code. Additionally, I would start and finish the assignment before the due date even comes close. I would most definitely work on time management and not think so lightly of the code. Overall, I would just do things sooner, instead of waiting.
