## A brief overview about myself

Hi everyone! My name is Kody and I am currently a sophmore. Currently, I am planning to major in MIS or Marketing. I decided to take MIS/ITM because my previous teachers heightened my interest in this field. Other than that, I joined on a whim. Some other facts about me? I am from Waipio, Hawaii and I attended Damien Memorial Highschool. I enjoy basically everything, but I especially enjoy being lazy in bed. I also really enjoy cooking and listening to different genres of music. That is all for now, see you soon!
