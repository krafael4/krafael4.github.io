## Invoice 1

This WOD was named “Invoice 1,” which you can find further details [HERE](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html). For this WOD, we needed to create a dynamic sales receipt containing at least five products. What was difficult about this WOD was that it was not hard-coded, so if we were to change a value, the document would still correctly calculate sections. 

This WOD proved difficult because I needed help inputting the table and ensuring everything was not hardcoded. Due to its simplicity, the more manageable portion of the WOD would be the initial defining variables. I slowed down on the later portion of the WOD, the table. For this WOD, I did not prepare for it, which was a drastic mistake because it added to my time spent working on it. However, I did similar things, like reviewing the screencast after my first attempt. For this next WOD, I should review the informative slides posted before our labs, and I would like to attempt a WOD with no screencast viewing.
