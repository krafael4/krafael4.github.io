## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:

## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement

## 3. Challenges and Achievements

## 4. Skill Development and Application

### 4.1 Reflect on the three skills ... 
The three levels in this course include syntactic, algorithmic, and application. Syntactic relates to understanding or writing code. Algorithmic is designing algorithms. Application is taking the first two levels and applying them to something like a website. I would say that the first level was the hardest for me to get out of. I did not know any code, and understanding the basic topics was very difficult for me. I think the most difficult concept for me to wrap my head around was the different coding languages. This level was very stressful as well because we kept on moving to different topics each week. I would have to admit there were tears because of this level. The next level would be algorithmic. This was another very difficult level as we had to take our understanding of how to write code, but now create code from the start. The difficulty came from thinking of what to code and how to code it. The last level is application, which was the easiest. It combined everything we have been doing, including labs, WODs, and exercises. I would say that I progressed fairly quickly at this level. 

### 4.2 Describe how the hands-on ... 



## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)

### 5.1 Discuss how the use of AI enhanced ... 
AI greatly enhanced my learning and productivity, specifically in how I understood what code meant and did. One example of how I used AI effectively was when I was given pre-made code in labs or Assignments 1-2. Whenever I was given code I did not understand, I would head to ChatGPT and say, "Explain each line of this code. Simplify points as much as possible." The response would be a bullet point list of simple explanations for each code. This proved very helpful throughout the course because of how effective it was. I did not need to do heavy research or call upon the professor. Another example that I recall was when I used ChatGPT to simplify code. When I had made lengthy "if-statements," I went to ChatGPT to simplify the code and make it shorter. It helped with the readability while still maintaining the core function of the code. 

### 5.2 Discuss how the use of AI inhibited ... 
AI greatly inhibited my learning and productivity, specifically in how lazy I would get with writing code. I sometimes relied too heavily on ChatGPT, and I suffered its consequences. Time constraints and the fact that I started a bit too late led me to use ChatGPT a lot. Assignment 2 is a great example of how it inhibited my learning, specifically my individual requirement. I had created "if statements" to create a loop that would increase the number of times I logged in, but then I was stuck on how to add the time. To solve that issue, I went to ChatGPT. Then, I got stuck on how the message could appear on the site. Again, I went to ChatGPT to solve that as well. I felt like ChatGPT made me lazy, especially when time was running out on my assignment. 



## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth

### 6.1: Explore how the skills ... 
The skills I acquired from this course include perseverance, determination, and problem-solving. These are beautiful skills as they can be applied to numerous future academic and professional endeavors. The first two skills go hand in hand. These skills enable me to have a positive mindset while traversing a complicated and difficult code. This can, of course, help me with future difficult classes. It can even aid me when I get difficult projects from my future boss or myself. Problem-solving is another great skill because it can be applied outside the scope of school and work. Problem-solving is needed in every aspect of your life, and I am glad I learned that skill in my youth. 

### 6.2: Discuss the potential ...
These skills would have very positive impacts on my career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems. MIS boasts a plethora of challenges, and I believe correctly using these skills can tackle them. I have learned that these skills are ideal from the assignments to the labs and future problems. On the other hand, I may pose a negative impact. With determination and perseverance, one may never know when to quit. I may work and work until my mental ability withers. Not only does this require me to tune my skills, but also to use these skills in moderation. 

### 6.3: Reflect on the ...
This was one of the most difficult courses I have ever taken in my limited time in college. This class offered a very difficult learning curve and taught me how to use my strengths to my advantage. Due to this, it was also one of my more valuable courses because it taught me so many things through the concept of difficulties. I believe that it exposed me to tasks that I will definitely face in the future. In summary, this class was a great lesson, and I am glad I got a hard introductory class rather than an "easy A class."
