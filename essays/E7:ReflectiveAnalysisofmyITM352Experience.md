## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:

## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement

## 3. Challenges and Achievements

## 4. Skill Development and Application


## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)

### 5.1 Discuss how the use of AI enhanced ... 
AI greatly enhanced my learning and productivity, specifically in how I understood what code meant and did. One example of how I used AI effectively was when I was given pre-made code in labs or Assignments 1-2. Whenever I was given code I did not understand, I would head to ChatGPT and say, "Explain each line of this code. Simplify points as much as possible." The response would be a bullet point list of simple explanations for each code. This proved very helpful throughout the course because of how effective it was. I did not need to do heavy research or call upon the professor. Another example that I recall was when I used ChatGPT to simplify code. When I had made lengthy "if-statements," I went to ChatGPT to simplify the code and make it shorter. It helped with the readability while still maintaining the core function of the code. 

### 5.2 Discuss how the use of AI inhibited ... 
AI greatly inhibited my learning and productivity, specifically in how lazy I would get with writing code. I sometimes relied too heavily on ChatGPT, and I suffered its consequences. 





## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth


### 6.1: Explore how the skills ... 
The skills I acquired from this course include perseverance, determination, and problem-solving. These are beautiful skills as they can be applied to numerous future academic and professional endeavors. The first two skills go hand in hand. These skills enable me to have a positive mindset while traversing a complicated and difficult code. This can, of course, help me with future difficult classes. It can even aid me when I get difficult projects from my future boss or myself. Problem-solving is another great skill because it can be applied outside the scope of school and work. Problem-solving is needed in every aspect of your life, and I am glad I learned that skill in my youth. 

### 6.2: Discuss the potential ...
These skills would have very positive impacts on my career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems. MIS boasts a plethora of challenges, and I believe correctly using these skills can tackle them. I have learned that these skills are ideal from the assignments to the labs and future problems. On the other hand, I may pose a negative impact. With determination and perseverance, one may never know when to quit. I may work and work until my mental ability withers. Not only does this require me to tune my skills, but also to use these skills in moderation. 

### 6.3: Reflect on the ...
This was one of the most difficult courses I have ever taken in my limited time in college. This class offered a very difficult learning curve and taught me how to use my strengths to my advantage. Due to this, it was also one of my more valuable courses because it taught me so many things through the concept of difficulties. I believe that it exposed me to tasks that I will definitely face in the future. In summary, this class was a great lesson, and I am glad I got a hard introductory class rather than an "easy A class."
