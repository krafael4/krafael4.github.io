## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
<br>
<br>
### 1.1 Acquiring basic programming ... 
A great example of this goal would be Assignment 1. In Assignment 1, I felt my basic programming skills come into play. I was able to utilize everything I learned from the beginning of the semester up until that point. For example, I was able to use CSS styling to format objects in a systematic and correct manner that displays functionality. 

### 1.2 Understanding why MIS people need ... 
Again, I would say that Assignment 1 is a good indicator for this goal. Without the ability to do basic coding, your website would not even be published or work. Assignment 1 was a guided assignment, and the only thing we needed to do was edit and basic code. 

### 1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in ... 
I would say that the WODs and Assignments were where I gained hands-on experience. The most obvious are the Assignments, which allowed me to create an application that works solely on coding. For example, I needed to find a way to get my purchased data into my invoice that displayed all the prices and whatnot. The WODs were another good indication of the goal because the WOD practice appeared in the later projects we worked on. 

### 1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS ... 
The Assignments were the first time I faced a ton of problems. Honestly, it was a headache, and I did not enjoy it much. One of the problems I recall was making the error messages pop up where the textbox was. Eventually, when I fixed that issue, another issue sprung up (the styling shifted). 

### 1.5 Experiencing and Understanding First-hand Project... 
I think I am using the Assignments a lot, but it's true. The assignments were a good indicator for project management, specifically how I tackled the issues systematically. Sadly, I did not get to work in teams, but that would have been beneficial for finishing the project earlier. I would also assume it would have been fun. 

### 1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing ... 
My overall course experience is a great indicator. Each lab, each WOD, and each assignment improved my ability to find issues and address them properly. I usually sought the console or inspected the website to see the errors. Overall, each day at ITM made me a little bit more confident. 


## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement


### 2.1 What did you learn from creating ... 
From creating a professional portfolio, I learned how to market myself in a creative way. I also learned how to do simple coding that implements objects onto a physical website shared with others. Other than that, I did not learn anything else. 

### 2.2 What did you gain from ... 
I gained a lot from the WODs. Specifically, I gained many skills related to perseverance and persistence. Persistence was something that tempered my numerous qualities. I struggled initially and kept referencing the screencast videos when I got stuck. Later on in the course, the screencast videos were removed, and I was forced to keep on going until I wanted the perfect score/time. I also gained experience and practice from the WODs. The WODs were extensions of the labs. If I didn't understand something from the labs, the WODs would give me more practice, which was very useful. 

### 2.3 Were the quizzes ... 
The quizzes didn't really help me prepare for the labs. To be honest, I felt like they limited your reading. All you needed to do was pick out specific points from the reading and use them for the quiz. I believe that just reading the posts was the best way to prepare for the labs. I did not really pay attention to the quizzes, although I did them all fairly well. 

### 2.4 and 2.5 What did you learn from ... labs/essays
The labs were a great way to put the readings into practice. I felt like I learned a lot, and my favorite lab was about forms. I felt like the whole lab went smoothly, and I even got the opportunity to help my friend (who is way better than me at coding). Additionally, I learned that the labs were quite simple. Most of the time, the questions had embedded directions (which were very specific). On the other hand, I learned how to write again with essays. This semester offered me little practice with writing, but these essays gave me the opportunity to stretch my legs a little. It made me learn how to examine myself and my situation. Overall, I learned a lot about myself and my coding with these essays. 

### 2.6 What did you learn from doing Assignment ...
Assignments 1 and 2 taught me a lot. The first thing I learned was the value of perseverance. These assignments gave me a headache, but they taught me to keep going despite the headache. One example was learning how to add hover text to an image. I was completely lost and ready to give up. However, instead of giving up, I focused my energy on finishing it. Additionally, these assignments taught me how to ask ChatGPT properly. Instead of being vague in your questions, you have to be very specific in order for the computer to know what to do. Lastly, I learned how to code from the basics. The assignments taught me how to code the basics and that the basics are key to understanding how the whole website works. Overall, the assignments were difficult but valuable at the same time. 

## 3. Challenges and Achievements


### 3.1 and 3.2 Detail the specific/ Explain how you overcame... 
I remember encountering two specific challenges: understanding what code meant and how to find issues within the code. Finding issues in code was the most annoying, especially the WODs. Whenever I found an error and took too long, I had to stop the timer and re-record the video. This proved rather annoying, especially if I was already filming for a long time. The other challenge is understanding what the code means. To overcome these challenges, all I could do was get over the challenge and keep on going. With this mindset, it forced me to learn how to do things. There is no way to sugarcoat it, but just by doing it. 

### 3.3 Highlight any particular ... 
There were not many significant achievements or milestones for me because I felt pretty average at everything. If I were to label an achievement, it was that the "forms" lab clicked instantly for me. I did not struggle with what the code meant or how to code; it just clicked with me. While paying attention during the lesson likely contributed to my success, the reason why it clicked with me remains a mystery. I guess it serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of learning. Other than that, I don't know any achievements or milestones. 

## 4. Skill Development and Application


### 4.1 and 4.2 Reflect on the three skills/ Describe how the hands-on ... 
The three levels in this course include syntactic, algorithmic, and application. Syntactic relates to understanding or writing code. Algorithmic is designing algorithms. Application is taking the first two levels and applying them to something like a website. I would say that the first level was the hardest for me to get out of. I did not know any code, and understanding the basic topics was very difficult for me. I think the most difficult concept for me to wrap my head around was the different coding languages. This level was very stressful as well because we kept on moving to different topics each week. I would have to admit there were tears because of this level. The next level would be algorithmic. This was another very difficult level as we had to take our understanding of how to write code, but now create code from the start. The difficulty came from thinking of what to code and how to code it. The last level is application, which was the easiest. It combined everything we have been doing, including labs, WODs, and exercises. I would say that I progressed fairly quickly at this level. The hands-on experience with web-based e-service greatly enhanced my understanding of MIS issues. In my opinion, these two assignments were the greatest lessons of this course. They showed me that perseverance is very important and without it, you may fall behind and get discouraged to continue. 


## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)


### 5.1 Discuss how the use of AI enhanced ... 
AI greatly enhanced my learning and productivity, specifically in how I understood what code meant and did. One example of how I used AI effectively was when I was given pre-made code in labs or Assignments 1-2. Whenever I was given code I did not understand, I would head to ChatGPT and say, "Explain each line of this code. Simplify points as much as possible." The response would be a bullet point list of simple explanations for each code. This proved very helpful throughout the course because of how effective it was. I did not need to do heavy research or call upon the professor. Another example that I recall was when I used ChatGPT to simplify code. When I had made lengthy "if-statements," I went to ChatGPT to simplify the code and make it shorter. It helped with the readability while still maintaining the core function of the code. 

### 5.2 Discuss how the use of AI inhibited ... 
AI greatly inhibited my learning and productivity, specifically in how lazy I would get with writing code. I sometimes relied too heavily on ChatGPT, and I suffered its consequences. Time constraints and the fact that I started a bit too late led me to use ChatGPT a lot. Assignment 2 is a great example of how it inhibited my learning, specifically my individual requirement. I had created "if statements" to create a loop that would increase the number of times I logged in, but then I was stuck on how to add the time. To solve that issue, I went to ChatGPT. Then, I got stuck on how the message could appear on the site. Again, I went to ChatGPT to solve that as well. I felt like ChatGPT made me lazy, especially when time was running out on my assignment. 



## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth


### 6.1: Explore how the skills ... 
The skills I acquired from this course include perseverance, determination, and problem-solving. These are beautiful skills as they can be applied to numerous future academic and professional endeavors. The first two skills go hand in hand. These skills enable me to have a positive mindset while traversing a complicated and difficult code. This can, of course, help me with future difficult classes. It can even aid me when I get difficult projects from my future boss or myself. Problem-solving is another great skill because it can be applied outside the scope of school and work. Problem-solving is needed in every aspect of your life, and I am glad I learned that skill in my youth. 

### 6.2: Discuss the potential ...
These skills would have very positive impacts on my career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems. MIS boasts a plethora of challenges, and I believe correctly using these skills can tackle them. I have learned that these skills are ideal from the assignments to the labs and future problems. On the other hand, I may pose a negative impact. With determination and perseverance, one may never know when to quit. I may work and work until my mental ability withers. Not only does this require me to tune my skills, but also to use these skills in moderation. 

### 6.3: Reflect on the ...
This was one of the most difficult courses I have ever taken in my limited time in college. This class offered a very difficult learning curve and taught me how to use my strengths to my advantage. Due to this, it was also one of my more valuable courses because it taught me so many things through the concept of difficulties. I believe that it exposed me to tasks that I will definitely face in the future. In summary, this class was a great lesson, and I am glad I got a hard introductory class rather than an "easy A class."
