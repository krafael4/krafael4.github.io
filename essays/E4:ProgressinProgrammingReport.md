## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I greatly agree with this. My ability to be grounded and code for more extended periods has dramatically improved. Additionally, my mindset when it comes to coding has also improved. At the start of the semester, I remember having to take multiple breaks within an hour because of my inability to concentrate. With assignments and projects like Assignment 1, I am now able to code for hours at a time. Finally, my problem-solving has greatly improved. I admit I sometimes need help identifying the problems, but once I do, it goes much better. One issue that I needed help finding was Assignment 1 IRs. I could not identify the issue with the message popping up, but after a while, I found it and was able to address it. 

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

To improve my programming skills, I need to memorize and identify specific coding lingo. For example, when simple things like functions arise, I have trouble formulating the content within that function. Overall, I need to improve my programming knowledge and be able to know things without searching it up. I want to emulate the professor in his knowledge of coding. Although this is my first time coding, in any way, I need to be able to be super knoweldgeable. Finally, I need to work on my time management. I see myself doing work really late even if I had the opportunity to do it beforehand. Overall, I agree that there is a lot to learn and work on to improve my programming skills. 

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

I have learned a lot from doing the WODs, especially if it does not have the screencast. Most of the WODs are similar to the lab exercises, so it adds to the work that I have already done. I think that once the screencasts were removed, learning became a lot more demanding and I had to actually try it. For example, one of the WODs I did had maybe 4+ attempts and because of reception, I learned so much about the topic at hand. WODs are great because it forces you to repeat and try and try. From those practices, learning eventually forces upon yourself. 

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

Overall, the labs have helped me learn, but I think they could be improved with some tuning (which I will discuss in the later part of the essay). Sometimes, I am able to complete them with confidence. I am able to confidently complete labs when we have a strong foundation and have done numerous exercises. I am not confident when we only do one exercise and are assigned the rest to do ourselves. Labs are a great opportunity to listen to the professor, and it is also a great time to ask questions. They have helped me very much by offering a foundation. 

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

Assignment 1 was a great experience, and I really enjoyed it. It taught me to push through difficulties. I really had difficulties with designing the initial store site, but after a while, it turned out great. Assignment 1 really pushed me to do a lot and it allowed me to push time and effort into something that I am really proud of. I feel I am ready to work on Assignment 2, but it seems very intimidating. Most of the hard work is done, but now we have to shift our time to more complex coding and storing. It should be a fun and demanding experience, something I am ready for. 

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

The class can be tuned in some little ways. I think that a portion of the start of the semester should be allocated to the professor teaching us basics rather than just us reading on our own. Another way I think the class can be improved is by allocating more time in class to complete the Lab. Sometimes, we start the lab with only 30 minutes remaining, and we have to end up completing it on our own. I think simple fixes like that can improve the class to help my learning.

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

The 3 things that help me most in class are WODs, working with classmates, and one-on-one help. WODs help me the most because they force me to learn and help me be quicker with coding and problem identification. Working with classmates is helpful because it offers me different perspectives and knowledge from people I already know/are familiar with. Finally, one-on-one help is helpful because it reduces the pressure and anxiety you would get if the whole class were listening and watching. Overall, these 3 things are the methods that helped me learn the most. I think without them, I would struggle with the class.
