## Browser History 1

This, by far, was the most complex and time-consuming WOD out of all the three. Most of the difficulties stemmed from me needing to figure out what to do or interpret the meaning of specific tags. This WOD taught me how to create hyperlinks and an itemized list with links to particular sections. More specifically, I learned to ID headers to match the itemized list links. This WOD took me four attempts, the 1st attempt being the longest. The 1st attempt took the longest because it was a trial-and-error period of around 45 minutes. To better understand the directions, I followed along with the screencast and essentially copied everything. Although the directions say to try yourself for the first time, I was completely lost and didn’t know what to do. I suggest you try this method when you have no idea what to do. 

The following two attempts took me around 20-30 minutes each and were practices for the final recording. These two attempts were solely memorization, and if I were to get stuck, I would reference the screencast. For these later attempts, I suggest taking notes and writing down code that doesn’t seem to click with you. I had trouble with “a href,” so I wrote that down on my notes app. The final attempt was the best because, after a ton of repetition, I got a time of 14 minutes. After repeating this WOD 4 times, I learned that repetition is critical to getting an RX time. I would suggest watching the screencast if you have no idea what to do, taking down notes of code that doesn’t click, and practicing. 


## Browser History 2

This was a good change of pace compared to the first WOD. This WOD was very simple yet challenging at the same time. This WOD took me three attempts, the first a trial and the rest a practice and final filming. Collectively (from all three attempts), I learned how to link CSS to an HTML file, quick solutions for the margins of a page, and how CSS files are formatted. My first attempt took around 26 minutes to complete. I explored solutions through the screencast, my general knowledge, and the CSS tutorial readings. I suggest reading about supplemental information before starting your first attempt. Working backward added a lot of minutes to my “time spent.” The second attempt took around the same amount of time because I had errors with the font. This error caused me to restart that attempt because it messed up my recorded time. The third and final attempt was the polished run of around 4 minutes. I would, again, suggest writing down any code that confuses you or is difficult to memorize (i.e., the code for linking Google fonts). I also advise spacing out and group your code so it looks organized. By grouping your code, I mean to place all body/all text attributes under “body” and so forth. I also recommend repetition and memorization so your body acclimates to the specific code. 

## Browser History 3

This third and final WOD would be medium challenging among the three. Although this WOD offers fewer steps than the rest, the intermediary coding between steps was a smudge more than WOD 3. For example, altering the unordered list offered some bulk. My first attempt was 25 minutes. It took me so long because I didn’t understand <div>, but I eventually got it as I checked the screencast afterward. This attempt is where I also began to take more notes. Notes are good because they allow you to remember to code better, especially during your recording attempt. The second attempt took me around 10 minutes, and I only relied on notes and memorization for this portion. The final attempt was around 7 minutes, and this is where everything clicked. I attribute my knowledge to the constant notes I kept writing down from either practice of the screencast.
